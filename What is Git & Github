- ðŸ’¡ Git is a distributed version control system that addresses the problems of sharing and versioning code. It provides a solution for teams working together on the same codebase, allowing them to collaborate effectively.
- ðŸ’¡ The difference between centralized and distributed version control systems lies in their architecture. Centralized systems rely on a central server for code sharing, while distributed systems allow developers to create their own copies of the codebase and share changes with others.
- ðŸ’¡ Git offers essential commands such as git add, git commit, and git push for managing code changes. These commands allow developers to track and commit their modifications, ensuring code versioning and collaboration.
- ðŸ’¡ The creation of a Git repository involves initializing a local repository using the "git init" command, adding and committing the files using "git add" and "git commit," and pushing the changes to a remote repository like GitHub using "git push."
- ðŸ’¡ GitHub is a platform built on top of Git that provides additional features for code sharing, collaboration, and project management. It allows developers to create repositories, share code with others, manage issues, and perform CI/CD workflows.
- ðŸ’¡ Using GitHub, developers can create forks of repositories, enabling them to have their own copies of the codebase to work on and contribute back to the original repository through pull requests.
- ðŸ’¡ GitHub's features extend beyond code sharing, offering project management tools like issue tracking, code reviews, and CI/CD integration. It provides a centralized platform for developers to collaborate, manage tasks, and ensure code quality.
