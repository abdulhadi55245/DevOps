Docker" and "containers" are closely related concepts in the world of software development and deployment, but they are not exactly the same thing. Here's the difference:
1.	Containers: A container is a lightweight, standalone, and executable software package that includes everything needed to run a piece of software, including the code, 
runtime, system tools, libraries, and settings. Containers are isolated from each other and from the host system, ensuring that they run consistently regardless of the environment. 
They provide a way to package and distribute applications along with their dependencies in a consistent and portable manner.
2.	Docker: Docker is a platform and set of tools that simplifies the process of building, managing, and deploying containers. Docker provides a way to package applications into 
containers using a standardized format called Docker containers. It also includes tools for managing containers, such as Docker Engine, which is responsible for running containers on a host 
system, and Docker Compose, which is used for defining and running multi-container applications.
In summary, containers are the technology that allows you to package and run applications in an isolated environment, while Docker is a specific implementation of container technology 
that provides tools and a platform for building, managing, and deploying containers.

ðŸ’¡ Virtual machines solved the resource utilization problem of physical servers, but containers provide even greater efficiency by reducing resource wastage. They allow for running multiple
applications on the same physical server or virtual machine, effectively utilizing resources.
ðŸ’¡ Containers offer logical isolation by creating a virtual operating system for each application, ensuring security and separation. However, they have some drawbacks compared to virtual 
machines, such as less complete isolation and potential security concerns.
ðŸ’¡ Containerization can be done on top of virtual machines or physical servers/cloud providers. Model 2, where containers are created on top of virtual machines, is becoming more popular 
due to reduced maintenance overhead and the shift towards cloud providers.
ðŸ’¡ The use of a containerization platform like Docker is essential for creating and managing containers. Docker can be installed on the host operating system of a physical server or a 
virtual machine to facilitate containerization.
ðŸ’¡ Organizations are increasingly adopting containers on virtual machines or cloud providers to reduce maintenance costs and take advantage of the scalability and flexibility offered 
by these platforms.
ðŸ’¡ Understanding the basics of containers is crucial before diving into advanced concepts like container projects and interactions between containers. Docker is a widely popular 
containerization platform that will be explored in detail in future classes.
ðŸ’¡ Building projects using Builder is another important aspect of the DevOps course. Builder integrates well with modern tools like Scorpio and Podman, and having knowledge of Builder is 
beneficial for working on complex projects.
