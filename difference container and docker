Docker" and "containers" are closely related concepts in the world of software development and deployment, but they are not exactly the same thing. Here's the difference:
1.	Containers: A container is a lightweight, standalone, and executable software package that includes everything needed to run a piece of software, including the code, 
runtime, system tools, libraries, and settings. Containers are isolated from each other and from the host system, ensuring that they run consistently regardless of the environment. 
They provide a way to package and distribute applications along with their dependencies in a consistent and portable manner.
2.	Docker: Docker is a platform and set of tools that simplifies the process of building, managing, and deploying containers. Docker provides a way to package applications into 
containers using a standardized format called Docker containers. It also includes tools for managing containers, such as Docker Engine, which is responsible for running containers on a host 
system, and Docker Compose, which is used for defining and running multi-container applications.
In summary, containers are the technology that allows you to package and run applications in an isolated environment, while Docker is a specific implementation of container technology 
that provides tools and a platform for building, managing, and deploying containers.
